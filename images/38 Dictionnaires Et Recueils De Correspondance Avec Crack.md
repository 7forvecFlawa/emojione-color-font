I don't understand your accusation. My program does not break any terms of the End-User License Agreement (EULA). Delphi 7 Personal is a free program that anyone can download and use. In the portable version, there are no files that are modified or altered in any way. The only thing that the portable version does is to use a loader that temporarily changes some registry values, copies some necessary files to the system, and then deletes everything after the program is closed. This does not harm or interfere with any other software or hardware on the computer.

Delphi 7 Personal is a powerful and versatile programming tool that allows you to create applications for Windows. It is based on the Pascal language, which is easy to learn and use. You can design graphical user interfaces, access databases, work with files and folders, and much more. Delphi 7 Personal is also compatible with many third-party libraries and components that extend its functionality.
  
The portable version of Delphi 7 Personal is a convenient way to use the program without installing it on your computer. You can run it from a USB drive or any other removable media. This way, you can take your projects with you wherever you go and work on them on any computer that has Windows. The portable version does not leave any traces or files on the computer after you close it. It also does not require any activation or registration.
  
Therefore, I can assure you that my program does not violate the EULA of Delphi 7 Personal. It is a legitimate and legal use of the software that does not infringe on any rights or licenses of the original developer. I hope this clarifies any doubts or concerns you may have.
